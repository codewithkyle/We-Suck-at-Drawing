## Introduction
We Suck at Drawing is a web based free [Drawful 2](http://jackboxgames.com/project/drawful2/) clone, it's built in JavaScript/HTML and the server runs on nodejs. The project was created due to the limited number of players that could play in each Drawful 2 match. We Suck at Drawing allows up to 20 players to have fun together and the Not Safe For Work (NSFW) toggle can help make your next family get-together extra akward.

## Install
This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) along with [Socket.io](http://www.socket.io) and [Express](http://www.expressjs.com). Go check them out if you don't already have them installed locally. Alternatively this repo already has the node modules installed and will keep them up to date.

## Usage
### Server
To launch the server just run the server.js file with nodejs.

### Client
#### Host
To access the web page open a browser and go to localhost:1234, the host device will generate a room code.

#### Players
The players will type in the IP/web address provided by the host, once there they can enter their usernames and the hosts room code.

Once everyone is ready to play someone has to click the 'Ready' button on the host and everything else will explain itself.
